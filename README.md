# BrokenChutesLadders
Attempt at making Chutes &amp; Ladders in VBA


An attempt to create chutes & ladders for codereview's monthly challenge June 2016 http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/6740/june-2016-community-challenge

This attempt was done in VBA and took about a dozen hours of my time, however I was unsuccessful. After several shortcuts, one unresolved bug (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37033537/sum-of-array-is-negative-and-trying-to-reach-constant-but-it-re-sizes-with-a-po) and absolutely no attempt to draw the gameboard, I've abandoned this project.

May it rest in peace.
